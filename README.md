# Inventory-Management-System
This repository contains all the codes along with JSON files which were used for making the Inventory Management System project

### I have made an Inventory Management System which works on NOSQL based database
1. I have used JSON file system for it.
2. New inventories can be added
3. Purchases can be done by the customers
4. Bills can be generated

There are 4 featues per product:
1. Product ID
2. Name of product
3. Price
4. Quantity of the product

My project can do the following things:
1. Update inventory with new products
2. Add quantity of already existing products
3. Display what items there are for a customer to buy from
4. Checks if we have enough quantity of products for the customer to buy
5. Allows customer to buy multiple items at a single run
6. Generate Bills
7. Show total sales done by the company and the time purchase was made
